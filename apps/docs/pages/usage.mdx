React Unforget is a Babel plugin. To use it, you need to install it and add it to your Babel configuration.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @react-unforget/babel-plugin
```

You also need to install `@react-unforget/runtime` as a dependency:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @react-unforget/runtime
```

Then, add it to your Babel configuration. For example, in your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [["@react-unforget/babel-plugin", { /* options */ }]]
}
```

## Usage with bundlers

### With Webpack

If you are using webpack, and `babel-loader` is not using a `.babelrc` file, you can add the plugin to your webpack configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            plugins: [["@react-unforget/babel-plugin", { /* options */ }]],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### With Vite

If you are using Vite and `@vitejs/plugin-react`, you can add the babel plugin to your `vite.config.js`:

```js
plugins: [
  react({
    babel: {
      plugins: [["@react-unforget/babel-plugin", { /* options */ }]],
    },
  }),
]
```

## Options

The babel plugin accepts a few options:

- `throwOnFailure` (default: `false`): If `true`, the plugin will throw an error if it fails to analyze the component / hook.
- `skipComponents` (default: `[]`): An array of component names to skip. For example, `["MyComponent"]`.
- `skipComponentsWithMutation` (default: `false`): If `true`, the plugin will skip components that have variables that are mutated e.g. `array.push()` or variable re-assignment. This is configurable because despite thorough testing, we are still not 100% sure that this is safe to do in all cases.

# React Unforget

React, despite its dominance, has shown signs of lagging in raw performance and bundle size when compared to efficient frameworks like Svelte. **React Unforget** aims to bridge this gap with intelligent memoization and optimization strategies.

<DynamicLiveCodeSandPack previewClassName="h-44">
{`import { useState } from "react";

export default function CounterWithMutationTracking() {
  const [state, setState] = useState(0);

let text = "The number is: ";

if (state % 2 === 0) {
text += "even";
} else {
text += "odd";
}

return (
<div>
<button onClick={() => setState(state + 1)}>Increment</button>
<div>
<span>Count: {state}</span> {text}
</div>
</div>
);
}
`}

</DynamicLiveCodeSandPack>

### How about React Compiler (Forget)?

As of today, React Compiler is not yet released. It's been in the works for a while and it's not clear when it will be released.

Having an alternative like React Unforget to the React Compiler is akin to what Preact is to React. It serves not just as a backup plan but as a boundary-pusher, challenging the status quo and driving innovation within the React ecosystem. By offering a different approach to optimization and performance enhancements, React Unforget encourages diversity in solutions and approaches, fostering a healthy competitive environment where the ultimate winner is the developer and, by extension, the end-user.

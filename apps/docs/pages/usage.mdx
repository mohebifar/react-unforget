React Unforget is a Babel plugin. To use it, you need to install it and add it to your Babel configuration.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev @react-unforget/babel-plugin
```

You also need to install `@react-unforget/runtime` as a dependency:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @react-unforget/runtime
```

Then, add it to your Babel configuration. For example, in your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@react-unforget/babel-plugin"]
}
```

If you are using webpack, you can add it to your `babel-loader` configuration:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
          options: {
            plugins: ["@react-unforget/babel-plugin"],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
